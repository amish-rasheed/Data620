The standout for me was definitely the Ube sliders. The soft, pillowy ube buns were unique and paired perfectly with the chorizo patty, sauce, and toppings. It was a creative take on Filipino fusion and absolutely delicious.

We also ordered the lumpia shanghai. They were generously sized, but the wrapper wasn‚Äôt as crispy as I would‚Äôve liked. The sauce, however, was flavorful and complemented the dish well.

The pork BBQ skewers were good ‚Äî tender meat with just the right amount of sauce that wasn‚Äôt overly sweet. While it didn‚Äôt quite compare to the BBQ skewers back home, it was still enjoyable.

The lechon was another highlight. The skin was perfectly crispy, and the meat was thick-cut, juicy, and tender with just the right amount of fat ‚Äî buttery but not rubbery. The sauce it came with wasn‚Äôt the traditional lechon sauce I‚Äôm used to; it leaned more vinegary, which didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark for me. The inasal rice was also underwhelming ‚Äî it lacked the bold garlic flavor I was expecting and tasted quite bland.

Overall, the service was great, and the staff were friendly and attentive. While I enjoyed parts of the meal, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be back.",3.0,1742606194,Kalye Broome,"[""Filipino""]","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.212, 'compound': 0.9948}",0.9948,positive,"['food_quality', 'service']"

Our reservation was for 7:30pm but we walked in 10 minutes early and were able to be seated!

We were served the lumpia shanghai and ube drinks to start our meal off. I loved that the lumpia was packed with meat and thin on the skin but the ube drinks were too grainy for our taste. I'm not sure it was a fav but would not order that again.

For appetizers we got the bbq skewers and kinilaw ceviche tuna. The BBQ Skewers are bigger than the traditional skewers I'm used to at Malay restaurants but still really good! I love that you could taste the charred bbq which is a good indicator for me! The ceviche on the other hand.. wasn't as delectable by itself but once we ordered a side of pita chips, we changed our tunes! I think it's a must to have some sort of carbs to pair with and may be a bit heavy.

Hubby and I ordered one of each for the two entrees offered - beef tapa w. sunny side egg and mushroom sisig (both served with rice). I like both as it's not too salty but I think it could be heavier on the flavour? The meat could be marinated a bit longer imo but it was still good regardless.

To finish off, we got the mango float and ube ice cream. I thought the mango float was going to be more of a milkshake but it's actually a piece of cake with a cherry on top! The ube ice cream is topped with shaved coconut and so so SO rich in flavour. I preferred the ice cream over the cake but my husband had different opinions.

FOOD
The food is excellent. If you're craving a wide array of Japanese food, this place really hits. During this visit we ordered the chicken karage, the tofu, and the roll cake. All incredibly delicious.

The karage was fried perfectly and came with lemon (which just makes so much sense) and a spiced mayo which was the perfect accompaniment. We asked for salt on the side which helped the flavors pop even more.

The tofu was also delicious. The broth that it was in + the bonito with the shaved ginger, gave it an incredible depth of flavor which is hard to describe. Umami if I were ever to taste it. Highly recommend.

The roll cake was the sleeper. Incredibly delicious with pieces of fruit embedded throughout. Very generous portion with a raspberry mousse on the side which was a perfect pairing.

SERVICE
This was outstanding. 10/10. They were extremely accommodating with our small baby and several staff members from various parts of the restaurant checked in on us throughout our meal to make sure that we had everything that we needed and that everything was okay. Truly memorable, especially given the restaurant was packed on a Saturday night and very, very busy. Service really punched above its weight class.

ATMOSPHERE
What else is there to say. This is prime SoHo on MacDougal. The energy is infectious. However, the smart layout of the restaurant optimizes the space so that there is quite a bit of seating (we were lucky to snag 2 seats a bit later in the evening for dinner w/o a reservation), but you still feel there is space to navigate through the restaurant.

Definitely get the curried goat patties. I also really liked the crispy okra. The oxtail was delicious, but surprisingly I preferred the sofrito roasted chicken. As for dessert, you know we had to do the cosmic brownie. I don‚Äôt know how they make the ice cream taste like powdered donuts‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a culinary feat!

The only con for me - I thought the host service lacked a bit of professionalism. We were seated at a table for two and asked to move shortly after. When I asked why, they said the table needed to be pushed together with the one next to it so that four people could sit there. The tables were never pushed together, nor was a party of four ever seated - only 2 separate parties of 2.

2. The service itself was a bit chaotic, and while the staff did a great job clearing plates, they lost track of what we had ordered at a point and looked to us to tell them what else was missing

We went when it opened at 11am on a Saturday. They are trying to go with hole-in-the-wall vibes with their interior, but the pricing is not aligned with that. The interior only seats about 5 people at a time, so try to either get takeout for the park or go at an off time.

My friend got the braised beef and noodles ($26), and I got the garlic noodles ($18). There is a 5% service charge, which I wish they disclosed, because I would have paid in cash if that was an option (it may not be). My friend commented that the noodles were almost gluey (maybe undercooked), the beef was nice and tender with nice flavor, but nothing else aside from the meat had flavor. The garlic noodles were very dry and also severely lacked flavor. I forced myself to finish it because of the price.

Location-wise, I understand why this place needs to have their prices so high. However, your food needs to justify those prices. Truthfully, even if their prices were lower, the noodles were not good. I think they should bring a few people in for taste testing and revamp their menu.

-Oysters (Sea Kist, Wellfleet, Wave Lengths, Upstate's Own, Blue Whale) - these were all east coast oyster because the west coast ones were sold out. East coast oysters are priced at $2.85 each, which is reasonable IMO for regular pricing. There are some types of oysters that are plumper than others, so you can always ask for recommendations. All of the oysters were pretty good but I did get a few that weren't properly shucked
-Little neck clams - I love a good clam, and these were nice and fresh. I might have liked them even more than the oysters
-Escargot (snails slow cooked in basil and parsley butter) - this was probably one of the worst escargot I've ever eaten. It didn't really have much flavor, and the butter tasted like movie theater popcorn butter
-Uni (Maine uni, quail egg, salmon roe with toast points) - this wasn't what I was expecting. It served on some sort of cauliflower puree (?), which masked the flavor of everything else. The bread also tasted a bit stale

For drinks, I had the dragon stout, which reminded me of a Guinness Extra Stout. It was pretty good. They also have a nice variety of other beers on draft. If that's not your thing, they've got some wine and a few cocktails, but none of the cocktails appealed to me that night.

Los Tacos has been hailed as the best taco in the city for a long time, and I recently came here while the memory of Taquer√≠a Ram√≠rez was still fresh. Funny enough, my first-ever taco was actually from Los Tacos No.1 at their Chelsea Market location almost a decade ago. Back then, it didn‚Äôt leave a huge impression, but I wanted to come back and see what I might‚Äôve missed.

Like TR, it‚Äôs CDMX-style with nixtamalized corn tortillas, but the overall vibe here leans more toward a classic Mexican street taco. The meats here pack more smokiness, while the tortillas at Ramirez still win for texture and flavor.

Nothing I had here topped the tripa taco from TR, but both the Adobaba and Carne asada were excellent. While Adobaba and Al pastor are both marinated pork, it‚Äôs hard to compare them directly. But personally, I prefer adobada for its juicier texture and that smoky finish. Bonus points for the guac here too, which you won‚Äôt find at TR.

I get why people are complaining about the price. Are the portions small for the price? Sure. But in a city where mediocre tacos cost just as much, this is still top-tier.

We ate mostly off the dim sum menu and everything was delicious.

We had:
Pork Soup Dumplings - amazingly delicious, savory, juicy dumpling served with a tangy vinegar & ginger sauce.
Beef pancake wrap - savory flakey crust surrounding tinder juicy beef, with fresh scallions & cilantro.
Dan Dan Noodles - spicy noodles with sesame paste& minced pork. My kids especially liked it but it does have a slight spicy kick but not strong. Beware this one is oily, it was crunched in oil, see my pictures.
Pork Pot Stickers - these were very flavorful & cooked to perfection, nice juicy dumplings with a slight crunch in the bottom.
Scallion Pancake  - flakey & soft, flavorful with a tasty dipping sauce. Tasted like the wrap on the Beef pancake wrap.
Egg Yolk Buns - steamed delicious soft black bread with a juicy combination of egg yolk, butter and sugar. Be careful how you eat this one or you‚Äôll get the liquid hot insides squirting all over your evening frock üòÜ
*the above are all dim sum sized portions, small in size but big in flavor.

We shared a chocolate mousse for dessert, which was chocolate creamy deliciousness covered in shaved chocolate but with a denser frozen white cream in the center. Not your traditional chocolate mousse center but still very delicious (see pictures).

I had the ‚ÄúMisty Rain‚Äù cocktail, which is a mixture of flavorful gin, longing tea & pear syrup. It was a refreshingly delicious well balanced simple tasting, lightly sweet drink that I would recommend. Be aware though that it is not served in the style of glass pictured in their drink menu  illustration. The picture shows it being served in a standard 8oz acopa cocktail glass, but it was actually served in a 4 oz tea cup. I would have preferred the glass they have pictured on their drink menu.

Next time we‚Äôre going to try more of the main entree dishes from the menu. We saw others enjoying what looked like really delicious food. We headed to a music show & my kids wanted a lite meal and could not resist ordering all the dim sum dishes.

Tips: we were a group of 3 and if you have less than 4 people you aren‚Äôt able to get a reservation after 4:30pm. So we ate at 4:30pm. It was a bit early, next time we‚Äôll invite someone to join us & get a later reservation.

The food was reasonably priced for the area. We paid $127.61 including tax & tip for the food & drinks I listed (see picture of receipt for more details).

g_1743975617_UBmSMr-isyuSTTpV5MFMRw,UBmSMr-isyuSTTpV5MFMRw,"Super cute place on second story of this apartment building. The food is definitely not fully authentic japanese. Its more like a pan asian twist on japanese izakaya classics. For example the chicken katsu don came with a sunny side up egg instead of the typical omelette/egg scrambled on top and they didnt put any onions in either. The breading on the chicken was unusually sweet as well it had almost that thai sweet chili flavor to it. I didnt mind it in the end but it was just unexpected and threw me off a bit. The dish costs $17 which I do think is too much for the amount they give you. It should be like $14 at the most for the portion size. The beef skewer was good but it was on the smaller side portion wise and it came with a heavy cumin seasoning which again was unexpected. I thought the flavor was good but again you dont normally expect to see cumin on japanese food. My wife liked her salmon don bowl.

I seriously question if the people that leave glowing 5 star reviews have ever been to an actual nice dinner.

From watching Instagram videos you would think The tortellini was the best pasta dish in the world, it‚Äôs not, It‚Äôs basic, just as I expected.

The drinks menu was awful. No cocktails. Just the basic old fashioned drinks. So if you don‚Äôt like martinis or manhattans you won‚Äôt find anything you like.

The duck, was another ‚Äúmust get‚Äù but it was a 6/10. They don‚Äôt properly render the fat, it had a thick gelatinous fat layer on it that made it unappealing.

The $22 affogato, two people at the table hated it. The proportions are off, It really just tastes like coffee ice.  But when you get a perfect bite of the fudge, ice cream, and a little bit of the ice, it‚Äôs a great bite. If they sold them on the street I‚Äôd buy one, but I‚Äôd never sit through another $640 dinner just to get one.

People are brainwashed into thinking this is good because they are told it‚Äôs good. If you have NO budget at all and are with a group, it‚Äôs a fun splurge meal.

Thai food in NYC is already some of the best, but I rarely go to a spot where everything on the menu slaps. This is one of those spots.

From the Thai iced coffee to the babka French toast with Thai tea butter the whole meal was extremely flavorful and light.

The Thai coffee is super smooth and the breakfast wrap is so flavorful while being a lot lighter than Win Son‚Äôs scallion pancake wrap. This is a breakfast item I‚Äôd eat regularly.

The disco fries and drunken dumplings were fun takes on more traditional Thai flavors and we really enjoyed them.

However, the coconut chicken which was basically a Thai schnitzel was the star and the lamb larb really balanced the richness of lamb with herbs, lime and heat.

They highlight my favorite element of Thai food which is that the food is flavorful but also light. We had so much food yet we didn‚Äôt feel heavy like we would after brunch.

Recommendation

- 100p recommend!
- Great date spot / place to celebrate a birthday/promotion/life.

Vibe

- In an ex church stained glass ceiling tastefully classy clean decor, friendly service, very high ceilings. Not cheap but all in all SO worth every dollar, honestly isn‚Äôt that expensive considering what you‚Äôd drop on a random dinner in WV. Cuz it‚Äôs so much food and portions are big and the food is so tasty.

Dishes

- Loved the kimchi (complimentary), so light and punch of flavor
- Spicy Fried Chicken ($22) was bomb
- Galbi-Jjim ($48): Was very clean but I kinda like / am used to something a bit heavier and sweeter but I can see how this is classier
- Pyeongyang Cold Noodle ($20): ppl in the comments were disappointed with it, but we loved it especially given that it was a hot day, the flavors are subtle but we liked it cuz it was so refreshing given all the other dishes.
- Hoe-muchim ($24): I think that was my favorite dish (it was salmon that night).

100p recc! They‚Äôre doing a $50 off $150 order till 5/11/25 I think (download the inKind app, it's on Moono's website)

All in all, I would say that this is a great place to try if you are in the area and want to go out with a group of people - just be prepared for the high prices.

When we arrived, the location was pretty busy, so we ended up sitting at the bar and had no wait time, which was great because it was very cold outside and we wanted to sit down quickly.

Our bartender was very quick to get to us, very pleasant, and was making funny banter with the other customers seated around us as well and made it an enjoyable experience to be there. The location and decor were nice, but there was kind of a weird smell that lingered in the air, sort of funky like musty garbage.

The food was expensive, but for being so close to grand central and other tourist locations, it is to be expected and not out of the original. My only issue with my food was that it was not warm, with everything just being kind of room temperature, which was very saddening.

The food was cooked very well, and all of the flavors were what I wanted. The chefs did not disappoint. I unfortunately think the food would have been much better with drinks, but thinking about adding that price on top of the already expensive meal is painful.

With all that said, I can suggest going here if you are visiting and want to host friends at a nice location where you can then immediately go and see some nice sites in the city.",3.0,1734993814,Parker & Quinn,"[""New American"", ""Bars"", ""Breakfast & Brunch""]","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.9881}",0.9881,positive,"['food_quality', 'ambiance', 'value', 'location', 'timing']"

When I got there, it was 11:20am, and even though google said they were open, the hostess told me that it would not open until 11:30a. She wasn't very pleasant when telling me this. I asked if the bar was open, and she said that they opened at 11:30am, as well, but her tone was as if she had to reiterate the information to an idiot. It was just a question since she said the kitchen was closed, I wanted to know if the bar was open. They serve brunch and have a brunch menu, so I thought they would have brunch hours.  I had the fennel sausage flat bread, and it was good. Nothing to write home about. The waitress was nice, so at least there was that. I mostly went to have a Bloody Mary, which looked good in the review pictures. Mine did not look like the pictures, and it was not good, in my opinion.

The amok was decent, the red curry mellow and the fish wrapped around the shellfish. However, I would say this dish is not as precise as the lok lak. The fish needs more punch. The red curry is actually too much, making the dish sloppy. I actually wonder if this would be better with the curry separate. At the least, the curry needs deeper flavor too, I want to tell the spices apart.

The frog legs were quite good, with vegetables that were crisp and frog legs that were moist. The sauce I think was a little too sweet, I could've done with more pepper. But I like the concept of the moist meaty frog legs - way better than chicken drums or flats - with crisp stir-fried peppers and onions. A better dish is there but this is decent.

The appetizer was a crudite and I remember liking the fermented fish and the steamed egg. But I didn't quite know how to eat the dish. The julienne was nice but the ergonomics was hard. Maybe scoops would have been better?

From the dessert side, the pudding was too sweet and the tapioca was better but the black beans were a little annoying. That being said, I think Bangladesh has a soft-and-hard custard like this so that maybe the style.

I opted for the bottomless unfortunately my date did not. However, it‚Äôs rare to find a brunch place that allows it without the entire table opting-in. The table next to us with a larger party also had someone not opt-in. I had the boozy iced coffee which was perfect, not uber sweet which I was happy for and the alcohol was pronounced.

Mediterranean food is not one of my top 10 favorite cuisines, but I loved Theodora.

As always, my reviews and ratings will focus almost exclusively on the food.

Ricotta toast: I agree with all the reviews saying this is one of their best items. Creamy, delicious, and the sweetness with the honey is very nice. Don‚Äôt skip this.

Za‚Äôatar kubaneh: fluffy, soft, and a great vehicle for the 3 delicious dips that come with it. My fav was probably the harissa, but all 3 were good. I think most people would agree though that the ricotta toast is tastier, if you were only going to get one bread dish

Red snapper ceviche: I love ceviches, and I could not fault this one. The pineapple works well, and I‚Äôd say it was one of the better ceviches I‚Äôve had in recent memory

Octopus: the octopus was cooked very well, nice and tender, and the sauce very good. I think the sauce could be improved a bit even further, but still, a delicious dish

Golden tilefish: the fish was tender and well cooked, and the sauce was nice. However, this is quite a mild tasting fish, and the sauce by necessity also relatively mild as to not overpower the fish; as a result, this was probably the least memorable dish of the night, and one I would not particularly care to get again.

Swordfish belly skewer: Delicious! I had seen some other rave reviews of this, and they were well earned. The fish was so fatty and tasty, and the sauce went well with it

Chocolate cake: the cake was not too sweet (very important!) and the mascarpone on top a nice pairing. Fantastic way to end the meal.

Also shoutout to our server, I don‚Äôt remember his name but he was excellent, and he even comped a drink at the table next to us when he realized one of the women hadn‚Äôt received her drink for a while.

My only real complaint with this restaurant is that the portions are small (not uncommon for many nyc restaurants), so if you have a healthy appetite, you will be spending at least $200 for two people, and you may still not be completely full. Having said that, I would be happy to come here again and try some of their other dishes.",5.0,1746040365,Theodora,"[""Mediterranean"", ""Cocktail Bars""]","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.726, 'pos': 0.256, 'compound': 0.9992}",0.9992,positive,"['food_quality', 'service', 'location']"

g_1734886148_NU_bgtavUAmLOPpC2cjkjw,NU_bgtavUAmLOPpC2cjkjw,"As a life-long vegetarian and one who is allergic to tofu and soy, it is a constant battle for me to find any sort of dish that is hearty, delicious and doesn‚Äôt make me feel sick to my stomach.  However, let me just say now that I have discovered this gem I can whole-heartedly state to others in the same predicament, look no further than Bj√∂rk Caf√© and Bistro at the Scandinavian Center right in the heart of NYC.  My Mother has been raving about the place for years, Swedish by decent she often attends concerts there then follows by having a meal of meatballs at the Caf√©.  Also, side beat here, this isn‚Äôt just for vegetarians, my Mom who has been consuming Swedish food since she was a child eats the traditional meat ones and professes her love just as much as I do at their flavorful-savory balls of joy. But, I digress back to the message at hand and my experience- despite my lineage it must be noted that I never really understood the whole meatball thing. That was until I tried these vegetarian meatballs and now let me just say they are on my ‚Äúdeath row‚Äù food list.  Balls of mixed veg that feel hearty, but with the right consistency of what a meatball should be. A bit chewy, yet with a toothsome-tasty bite that comes in a hot skillet bathing in a sea of mushroom gravy.  Two heaping sides of mashed potatoes, lingonberry and a small heap of cucumber salad make this the Swedish dish of the year. So warm and comforting, yet you don‚Äôt leave with a belly bomb rather a feeling of satisfaction that your satiated your hunger and body with great, healthy ingredients that are not only delicious but good for you too. Not to be missed either, is their infamous princess cake. Another Swedish delicacy I ordered one specifically for my sister‚Äôs birthday with many a friend asking me, ‚Äúwhy on EARTH would you get your sister a green cake for her birthday?!?!‚Äù All were immediately silenced once they sampled the light as air confectionary at her birthday party. My phone continuing to beep more than a drug dealer‚Äôs pager on New Year‚Äôs Eve for days later with friends raving about it and still does to this day. Ulrika (the head chef) and her team just know how to do it right.  This wondrous establishment isn‚Äôt just for those from Scandinavia, it‚Äôs for anyone looking for great quality food at a reasonable price all throughout the day. Lastly, they are perhaps the kindest kitchen team I have ever come across. As a former food blogger and culinary consultant and marketer, never have I experienced such gracious generosity as I did recently with Bj√∂rk Caf√©.  I sent them an off-handed emailing thinking nothing of it, describing how my family and I were holed up in Long Island during the holidays which was a difficult time for us and how we so missed having their traditional food.  Meant more as a compliment then anything else, yet no sooner had I sent the email did my inbox ping with a reply that they would only be more than happy to find a way to deliver us a meal. Keeping in mind that this is at the height of their busiest time of year, with yule boards and the Santa Lucia festival. Even still, they made and took the time to carefully wrap, package and send three orders of their vegetarian meatball meals to me and my family in Long Island. I have never in my life been so touched by the gesture or the food. At a relatively painful time for us, the savory aromas and fond memory-inducing fare brought sweet moments of joy and reflection.  It is true what they say, ‚Äú""Food, in the end, in our own tradition, is something holy. It's not about nutrients and calories. It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity."" - Louise Fresco. This could not be truer for  Bj√∂rk Caf√©, head chef Ulrika and her wondrous staff. If you ever find yourself in the area, right on Park Ave. in NYC stop in for a meal that will not only leave you gastronomically satisfied but with a true sense of hygge like a warm hug from a long-lost Norsemen gnome of a grandparent.",5.0,1734886148,Bjork Cafe & Bistro,"[""Salad"", ""Cafes"", ""Scandinavian""]","{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': 0.9985}",0.9985,positive,"['food_quality', 'service', 'value', 'location']"

Tucked away in the heart of the city, Linden‚Äôs American Restaurant isn‚Äôt just another spot trying to slap ‚Äúgourmet‚Äù on its menu ‚Äî it means it. From the moment you walk in, there‚Äôs a cozy yet confident vibe that makes you feel like you‚Äôve discovered something special. But let‚Äôs cut to the chase: the food is where Linden‚Äôs really shows off.

First up: the burger. This isn‚Äôt your average patty-on-a-bun situation. We‚Äôre talking perfectly seared, juicy beef that‚Äôs seasoned like someone in the kitchen really cares. The bun is soft but holds its own, and every topping ‚Äî from the melty cheese to the tangy house-made sauce ‚Äî adds something real to the bite. It‚Äôs the kind of burger that demands your full attention. And yes, you will find yourself thinking about it later.

Now, let‚Äôs talk fries. These golden beauties come out hot, crisp, and salted just right ‚Äî none of that soggy, over-seasoned nonsense. They‚Äôre the kind of fries that dare you not to finish the whole plate before your main even hits the table.

And then there‚Äôs the steak ‚Äî tender, flavorful, and cooked to that perfect balance where it practically melts in your mouth. It‚Äôs clear Linden‚Äôs isn‚Äôt cutting corners; everything from the quality of the cut to the way it‚Äôs plated shows care and craft.

Whether you‚Äôre looking for a casual dinner or showing a friend your new favorite spot, Linden‚Äôs hits that sweet spot between comfort and class.

The carrot salad looked great but did not come together well. The raw carrots were pretty but not nice to chew. The ostensibly cooked carrots were also pretty undercooked so the whole thing just didn't work for me.

The lasagna looked fantastic but it seem to be lacking in cheese on the inside and not a lot of sauce so it was kind of dry. There was plenty of cheese on top but it didn't carry the dish .

Of course I heard of this place through Keith Lee.. I went on a Saturday at 4 & everything was sold out. I wasn‚Äôt a fan that they wait to tell you this news until you‚Äôre inside (already in line) and at the counter. They should consider having a sign outside.

The location was in East Williamsburg which is a chill area. So I was surprised they had a ‚Äúsecurity guard/ bouncer‚Äù indicating when you can come into the room. The process was very confusing and I didn‚Äôt know even with his guidance on when it was my turn. It would be great if they clear signs in general on what was happening. Definitely felt out of place.

The food that was available was good! The Mac and cheese and fried chicken was good. And they do tell you how long to wait for the other items.

Truffle Brussels sprouts tasted a little bit
Salty. Double bacon, is pretty good like beef jerky.

Carnegie Diner is a gem!

This is my third time visiting, and every visit has been wonderful ‚Äî especially because of Nick, our amazing server.

Every bite was satisfying and memorable!

And don‚Äôt miss out on dessert ‚Äî Carnegie Diner has a huge selection, from pastries to cakes to milkshakes. Everything looks (and tastes) irresistible, so make sure to save some room after your meal.

We got there around 7pm and it was quite busy, but there were still a handful of open tables (turnover was pretty fast so l don't think I saw people having to queue in general, even though there was a pretty continual flow of people in and out).

I ordered the smoked turkey triple decker, which was really delicious. The turkey and bacon were surprisingly flavourful and not too oily, and the mayo and whatever other sauce they add fit really well. The bread was really oily, but this was more of an inconvenience in terms of holding the sandwich rather than the flavour profile.

My friend had the symphony breakfast with scrambled eggs. Overall, it was fine, but nothing particularly stood out. The eggs and hash browns were pretty meh, but the fresh fruit were a nice touch.

We also had an order of the caramel French toast to share. The toast itself was really yummy, but the sliced apples on top were bland (if not sour), which unfortunately did not serve to balance how sweet everything else was (incl the massive dollop of mascarpone haha).

Portion sizes, as one would expect of classic Americana, were quite massive, and I only ate half of my sandwich. We managed to get through most(?) of the french toast and my friend did finish his breakfast plate.

Price point was a bit high but not crazy for the amount of food and the location.

A cute little spot in the neighbourhood.
We got the following:
Short rib shawarma hummus - yum! I wish it came with more pita. The pita was delicious as well!!
Falafel - our waitress told us it is not a traditional kind, it is creamy inside, and it surely is! And we don‚Äôt mind it, quite interesting and yummy!

Lamb shank - the price tag is high, and it is a tad bit salty but works very well with the cabbage and the mini pita breads!

We were so full so we barely ate the lamb and got it to go. The sad part was when we got home, we realised that the restaurant packed the meat but not any of the sauce and cabbage and hummus that we barely touched.:(

Lovely restaurant! Great friendly and quick service with a cozy but spacious ambiance. Came here for dinner on a Friday night with a reservation.

*FOOD*
The mushroom hummus was my favorite, it was nice and garlicky, served with freshly made pita bread.

The brussel sprouts were roasted to perfection, but a bit too sweet from the honey.

I wouldn‚Äôt get the Blue Crab Kousa again, there wasn‚Äôt much flavor aside from the mint and the dish was mainly squash.

We tried many appetizers and all of them tasted great. I was surprised by how good some of them were.

Shawarma was okay, they just wasted good ingredients on an unbalanced dish that only sounds good on paper. The meat is too rich and the acidity of vegetables can't cut through all the fat.

Their pricing model of the dips felt like a scam. One costs $15 (which is already a lot) and it comes with a single pita. Inevitably you finish your pita before the dip runs out and you are now forced to order more pitas and they are $4 each. Instead of calling it a $19 dip which people would not buy. Instead, they make it seem like you ordered something extra.

While the food was good, I wasn‚Äôt sure that I‚Äôd come back at the end of our meal; but will definitely give them another shot, and bring others with me for the experience.

Original review: If I were solely rating on the flavor of the food and service during our meal, it'd be 4 stars; but I'm taking a couple stars off for lack of internal communication which made for a rather stressful start to our meal, and a rushed end. We had a reservation weeks in advance for a larger party, none of us had been there before and this was a reunion of sorts. Not only this; but we had already paid half the bill (which included a 20% tip) up front. So when we arrived that were told that they were not expecting us, we were rather annoyed and disappointed. To be fair, the hostess did a GREAT job pivoting, contacting the manager and made it work in the end; but we were left with a little over an hour to dine, and there was some confusion at the end around the rest of the payment as well.
The food and food service itself was quite good, and while we left pretty satisfied, we were not quite full, which was a bit disappointing, as I was assured that the chef would take ""good care"" of large family meals, when I asked about how many dishes would be served. For example, we were only given one serving of the seafood jjajagmyun. We kept waiting for them to bring another as one serving seemed a bit silly to split amongst 7 people, but that's all we got ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I‚Äôve been going Anything at all for several years now. There are ups and downs in taste and service. I mostly had good experiences though.

Food:
I figured the taste is different in a good way and a bad way depending on the time I dine in. They try to use seasonal ingredients and it changes the vegetable and fruit components on the dish. I think this is good try and not a major change of the main flavor.
I assume there are different kitchen staffs and differently cook meats..? Sometimes, proteins are burnt till taste bitter. Especially, on my last visit, I only tasted bitterness from my sandwich. I think the consistency of taste is really important. Like, I expect to have the same burger whenever I go to this place but it is disappointing when it doesn‚Äôt taste the same.

Service:
Most of staffs are friendly and willing to explain things according to customer‚Äôs needs. But, I had some staffs who didn‚Äôt explain delay on the food or rush out to eat or not getting what‚Äôs asked for.

Overall, I had better experience brunch than dinner. Apparently, their burger is my and my husband‚Äôs favorite burger in New York City. We always bring people when someone visits us. 70% was successful. Everyone was impressed with the taste, atmosphere, and service.

My biggest issue was with the speed. We felt like we were being rushed as they have to go through 8 courses in less than 2hrs and turn tables. Some courses came before we were done with the previous one. The service level felt more like a diner. In some ways it was like an America tapas place without the relaxed atmosphere.

It‚Äôs very rare for me to see fancy Mexican. So I was very excited to try this place. I got a reservation around 7, but it definitely isn‚Äôt needed & a walk-in is easily attainable. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and reminds me of my time in Mexico City. This is a weird statement, but I‚Äôm obsessed with the bathroom. It‚Äôs so welcoming and warm and it smells lovely. Really good job.

I came with a new friend so when I saw bar seats available I immediately took them vs going for a table. While the restaurant is rich in culture, around the corner of the bar was what felt like storage or trash. Since it‚Äôs a fancier place, they should consider hiding that in a closet or in the back versus next to a bar.

What got me here is watching a TikTok talk about how & how long they make their corn tortillas. So when I learned happy hour is until 7pm & it includes a free steak taco, I was very excited. Unfortunately it was hard and not good. I can do simple items when the seasoning is there. But it wasn‚Äôt. Extremely disappointing. Should add an avocado crema or something.

We ended up only getting guacamole & the tuna tostado. The guacamole was big and a great portion. The tuna tostado was very tasty and a nice redemption. But I definitely want to come back & try other items before a fair review. Also just noting there was only one waiter and one bartender.

And the chicken pot pie lacked oomph and richness‚Äîthe puff pastry crust was too flaky, as in it basically shattered and dissolved into ultra thin flakes that were unable to carry the cream sauce, and the chicken filling was also kind of bland, lacking that classic comforting celery salt flavor and mostly consisted of big chunks of mushroom.

We have been trying to expand our search for good restaurants outside of our normal stomping grounds, and decided on Tong, as it has been on the Michelin guide list 4 years in a row. 4-peat is crazy. Although, what does the Michelin man really know about food?

We hopped off the L-Train in Bushwick and made the short walk to Tong, through brightly painted warehouses that you can‚Äôt tell if they are occupied or empty. Bushwick is so unique.

We arrived ready to EAT. We sat down and deliberated over the menu for longer than I care to admit, and decided on the following:

Beef tartare, Yum Naem, Oysters, Beef Pad See Ew, Crab Curry, Chicken Green Curry, Massaman Brisket, Fried Branzino, and the Fillet Branzino. A laughable amount of food. I don‚Äôt know why we thought we could eat all that.

When you sit down, the servers first question is ‚Äúare you guys okay with spicy food?‚Äù Big bro confidently nodded his head with a look of slight disrespect on his face as if to say ‚Äúdo you know who I am?!‚Äù Next thing I know he‚Äôs running to the bathroom to go splash some water on his face after 1 bite of the crab curry. Food can be SPICY in here so if you can‚Äôt handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.

I normally only highlight one dish to try and keep these reviews short, but this food was sensational, so imma highlight a few. Our favorites were the Fried Branzino, Massaman Brisket, and the Pad See Ew.

The Fried Branzino is really what will bring me back here. It will keep me up at night thinking about how good this was. You get the entire fish seasoned with turmeric, black pepper, fried garlic, and lemongrass. It was the perfect dish.

The owner, Pat, came over to our table to talk to us for a bit. She was such a sweetheart, and so passionate. She also told us that they order the Pad See Ew noodles fresh every single morning from this market close by. Running a restaurant must be so hard, so shout out to Pat.

We pride ourselves on never taking leftovers, but we took a huge L here. We walked out of here like a couple of DORKS with bags of food. I felt like a little kid bringing my lunch to school smh.

Great service, great people, and great food in here. I‚Äôll be back.

We ordered fish tacos and classic guacamole. I‚Äôm not a big fan of fish, but those fish tacos were really, really good. The guacamole was fresh and tasty, a perfect match with their totopos.

**Main Course:**
I really wanted to try their Pollo en Mole Poblano, but we arrived too early for it. However, it was very kind of them to open the lunch menu for us before 4 PM.

**Enchiladas Suizas:** Five stars! I loved how they were prepared. They had the perfect level of spiciness, enhancing the flavors without being overpowering. This is exactly the amount of spice I enjoy in a dish.

**Huarache de Camar√≥n:** This dish included masa dough, grilled shrimp, bean pur√©e, Swiss cheese, and roasted salsa. The roasted salsa was incredible‚Äîso rich in flavor. Five stars!

**Branzino Veracruz:** This dish featured Branzino with Veracruz sauce and Mexican rice. It had incredible, rich flavors. It was lightly spicy, just enough to enhance the experience. Five stars!

I am a big fan of desserts and always look for something interesting and memorable.

I ordered their Tres Leches cake made with pulque and corn flour. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very happy with my choice. The flavor was different‚Äînot too sweet, just perfect. It was a unique experience that I really enjoyed.

I highly recommend the octopus as it is grilled to perfection with a nice smoky char and crisp edge. The cheese is sweet and savory. And the assorted spread is a nice taste of cold dips. And the Greek potatoes are seasoned very well and very easy to share.

However the chicken souvlaki was just okay, the flavors are decent but the chicken itself was overcooked. The lamb is grilled nicely, however it lacks seasoning.

The menu is seasonal, so it changes to feature fresh ingredients based on the time of year.

- The Savoy spinach was super fresh and had a nice balance of flavors.
- The grilled Carolina shrimp cocktail was cooked perfectly, with just the right seasoning.

I went with the Cookshop Burger, cooked medium rare, served with pickles, onions, and crispy fries. It was juicy and packed with flavor‚Äîdefinitely worth trying. My boyfriend had the fish, and he was very happy with his choice.
We were satisfied with the portion sizes and had just enough room for dessert.
Dessert:
- We opted for the apple crisp, which had a delicious pecan streusel topping and a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream. The warm, crunchy topping paired perfectly with the soft apples, and the ice cream brought everything together nicely.

From the warmth of the service and the softly lit interiors with cozy booth style seating beckoning you in, to the variety in the menu that brings some instant favorites, La Marchande is the full package crowd pleaser with dishes that will please not only the eyes but also the palate.

Would like to give a special shoutout to Abe who's served us twice and exudes hospitality! He also has a wonderful way with words when it comes to describing dishes we asked about, truly bringing the menu to life as he went over the flavors in the dishes down to the details of the garnish. We were tempted to order almost everything he described lol.

Now onto the food - at this point I've eaten probably half the menu, so here's the rundown!

Apps:
+ Milk Bread (5/5) - Simply *the BEST*. We have and will continue to order this every time I eat here. So fluffy and warm and the Scallion Cr√®me Fra√Æche pairing is perfection.
+ Crispy Octopus (5/5) - Another must order, super crispy and well paired. A crowd favorite.
+ Buttermilk Fried Calamari (5/5) - A new addition to the menu from our third visit. Was really impressed by how thinly coated the calamari was, offering a delicate crunch that still lets the seafood shine. The aioli is made in house and is a delicious pairing.
+ King Salmon Carpaccio (5/5) - The maple soy was really refreshing to have on the carpaccio (I typically see variations of some kind of citrus vinaigrette), sweet and savory goodness
+ Squash rigatoni (4/5) - Surprisingly great!! Wasn't expecting much considering this isn't an Italian restaurant but the pockets of squash puree that get nestled in the rings of the rigatoni were so delicious.
+ French Onion Dumplings (3.5/5) - Dumplings were great and packed with flavor but I wish the french onion soup they were bathing in was less concentrated and more drinkable.
+ Caesar Salad (3/5) - Solid but not remarkable, tad salty.
Truffle Pappardelle (2/5) - maybe was an off day, was too salty unfortunately

Mains:
+ Wagyu Boneless Ribeye w/ au poivre sauce (4/5): Cannot expect A5 levels of melt in your mouth but was tender and well seasoned. Would not skip eating the fried rosemary it comes with!! Convinced the table this was not simply a decorative element but really enhances the flavor of the steak üôÇ Also highly recommend the au poivre!
+ Hanger steak w/ chimichurri (4/5): Liked this more than the tomahawk
+ Tomahawk ribeye (3/5): Made me realize that I definitely prefer dry aged steaks flavor wise
+ Ora king salmon (4/5): I would ask for medium rare, the second time we ordered it the fish was less tender than the first even though we asked for medium both times. Couldn't get enough of the squash puree that accompanied it. On third visit the puree is now some kind of pea puree with morel mushrooms but still delish!
+ Grilled Lamb Rack: I honestly cannot remember this dish super well because I had gotten so full when I tried this one lol but think the folks around me enjoyed it. Generous serving size, came with 3 racks.

Sides:
+ Asparagus (4.5/5) - tasted fresh, loved the char and zest on it
+ Lamb fried rice (4/5) - was not expecting the asian fusion here, but the chili crunch worked well (on my third visit I see this is now off the menu sadly)
+ Cremini mushrooms (3.5/5) - Solid, liked the little crunch coating the belly of these.
+ Roasted brussels (3/5) - pretty standard flavor wise with classic caramelization, but as this dish often is, was too salty for my taste

Dessert:
+ Pecan Paris-Brest (3/5) - Certainly a large portion (can imagine sharing it with up to 8 people, would not recommend ordering if only a party of 2) but not my favorite variation of a cream puff. Liked the candied pecans but overall bit too sweet for me.

Drinks - light and refreshing, would order both again!

What truly elevated the experience, though, was the incredible service. Our server, Ethan, was outstanding‚Äîgracious, knowledgeable, and genuinely attentive without ever being overbearing. He guided us through the menu with thoughtful recommendations and made sure we felt taken care of throughout the night. You could tell he truly enjoys what he does, and it made all the difference.

The entire team deserves praise. The kitchen executed each dish flawlessly, and the staff moved in perfect sync to create a seamless, first-class experience. I left feeling both full and genuinely appreciated as a guest.
